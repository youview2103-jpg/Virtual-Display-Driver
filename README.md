This project creates a _virtual monitor_ in Windows that functions just like a physical display. It is particularly useful for applications such as **streaming, virtual reality, screen recording,** and **headless servers—systems** that operate without a physical display attached. 

Unlike traditional monitors, this virtual display supports custom resolutions and refresh rates beyond hardware limitations—offering greater flexibility for advanced setups. You can also use custom EDIDs to simulate or emulate existing hardware displays.

| **[BurnBin](https://burnb.in)** | A portable Windows file-sharing tool that turns your own PC into a temporary file drop. Share files with short-lived public links, optional return uploads, endpoint health checks, managed BurnBin links, Cloudflared fallback links, and Direct IP sharing when available. |
| **[FireFetch](https://firefetch.app)** | A private media-saving app for building an offline library from videos, songs, playlists, torrents, and direct files. It uses tools like yt-dlp, FFmpeg, aria2c, MusicBrainz, YouTube Music metadata, and local indexing to save, queue, organize, and browse media without cloud lock-in or AI-generated recommendations. |
| **[InfinitePIP](https://infinitepip.app)** | An always-on-top desktop picture-in-picture tool that turns live screens, app windows, and custom regions into borderless floating windows. Create multiple PiPs, pan, zoom, adjust opacity, keep captures above other windows, and even run virtual monitors from Virtual Display Driver inside floating PiP views. |
| **[BurnFlix](https://burnflix.app)** | A local-first media server that turns movies, shows, personal videos, games, and apps into one polished, living room-ready library. It loads from an offline cache, scans in the background, enriches metadata with providers like TMDB, OMDb, TheTVDB, Steam, Libretro, and IGDB, and keeps artwork, recommendations, and library health local. |

## 🧾 Changelog (recent)

- **PCI-bus based GPU selection (LUID)**: Improved multi-GPU render adapter selection by resolving an adapter **LUID from a PCI bus number** (more deterministic than name-only matching).
- **Device/PCI-slot friendly naming**: Improved device identification / friendly naming using DeviceID and PCI slot info.
- **GetIddCx helper tool**: Added source for the `GetIddCx` utility to query IddCx versions.
- **EDID integration**: Added EDID integration support for custom/virtual monitor profiles.
- **Performance optimization**: Driver performance improvements (various internal optimizations).

## Building from source

This repository uses a Git submodule for Microsoft Windows Driver Frameworks headers. Clone with submodules enabled:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/VirtualDrivers/Virtual-Display-Driver.git
```

For an existing checkout, initialize the submodule before building:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## ⬇️ Download Latest Version

- [Driver Installer (Windows 10/11)](https://github.com/VirtualDrivers/Virtual-Display-Driver/releases) - Check the [Releases](https://github.com/VirtualDrivers/Virtual-Display-Driver/releases) page for the latest version and release notes.
- **Winget:** `winget install --id=VirtualDrivers.Virtual-Display-Driver -e`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before using the Virtual Display Driver, ensure the following dependencies are installed:
> - **Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable**  
>   If you encounter the error `vcruntime140.dll not found`, download and install the latest version from the [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable page](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170).
>
> **Driver update safety:** If you're about to install **major GPU/chipset driver updates**, uninstall VDD first. If you get a black screen or display priority gets scrambled, boot into **Safe Mode** and uninstall VDD to recover.


## 🛠️ Installation

- Step 1: Download the Virtual Driver Control app.
   - You can download the installer directly from the [Releases](https://github.com/VirtualDrivers/Virtual-Display-Driver/releases) page.

- Step 2: Extract to a folder and run the app
   - Launch the VDC.
   - Click the Install button.

- Step 3: Verify the Installation (Optional)
   - Check if the Virtual Display Driver is correctly installed by running the following:
   - **Device Manager:** Check "Device Manager" under "Display Adapters."
   - **Settings:** Check display settings under system settings and see if the virtual displays show.

While VDC is a good and friendly way to work with VDD, you can also do a a lot manually. Like adding or removing resolutions or enable/disable 
functions, which is done by editing vdd_settings.xml. You should be able to locate the file at the default location: 
```C:\VirtualDisplayDriver\vdd_settings.xml ```

For more information about manual installation, uninstallation and "personalization", please check out the [Wiki](https://github.com/VirtualDrivers/Virtual-Display-Driver/wiki) here on 
the project GitHub repository. If you are into tinkering, check out the Powershell scripts in [Community scripts](https://github.com/VirtualDrivers/Virtual-Display-Driver/tree/master/Community%20Scripts).

## Troubleshooting 
### ⚠️ Important: GPU/Chipset Driver Updates

VDD can conflict with major driver updates, causing display priority issues or black screens on boot.

**Before Updating Drivers**

If you're planning to update GPU or chipset drivers:
1. Uninstall VDD first (via VDC app or Device Manager)
2. Complete your driver update
3. Reinstall VDD

**If You're Stuck at Black Screen**

*Boot into Safe Mode:*
* Force shutdown 2-3 times until Windows Recovery appears
* Choose: Troubleshoot → Advanced Options → Startup Settings → Restart → F4 (Safe Mode)

*Remove VDD:*
* Open Device Manager in Safe Mode
* Expand Display Adapters → Uninstall Virtual Display Driver
* Restart normally

*Quick Fix Alternative:*
* Press `Win + P` at black screen
* Press ↓ arrow and Enter multiple times to cycle display modes

**Why This Happens**

During driver updates, Windows re-enumerates display devices and may prioritize the virtual display over your physical monitor. Since VDD has no physical screen attached, this results in a black screen even though Windows is running normally.
